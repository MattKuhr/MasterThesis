abstract = {Head Mounted Display (HMD) based Augmented Reality (AR) allows users to access digital information related to real-world objects without being distracted from their real-world task. With the introduction of the HoloLens (and increasingly other similar devices) a platform allowing widespread practical application of such solutions has finally become available. However, today, not many such real-world applications exist, and it is not yet fully understood which specific applications can benefit most from the technology in what form. As a promising novel application that optimally leverages the advantages of HMD based AR we propose a HoloLens based solution to support the debugging of electronic circuits. As a first step we have implemented a HoloLens interface to an oscilloscope. In this paper, we describe the general idea, the first implementation of the oscilloscope interface, and summarize initial qualitative feedback that we have received from users.},

abstract = {This paper provides a multi-disciplinary overview of the research issues and achievements in the field of Big Data and its visualization techniques and tools. The main aim is to summarize challenges in visualization methods for existing Big Data, as well as to offer novel solutions for issues related to the current state of Big Data Visualization. This paper provides a classificationof existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality displays and Augmented Reality helmets on the Big Data visualization as well as to the classification of the main challenges of integrating the technology.},

abstract = {We report on a controlled user study comparing three visualization environments for common 3D exploration. Our environments differ in how they exploit natural human perception and interaction capabilities. We compare an augmented-reality head-mounted display (Microsoft HoloLens), a handheld tablet, and a desktop setup. The novel head-mounted HoloLens display projects stereoscopic images of virtual content into a user's real world and allows for interaction in-situ at the spatial position of the 3D hologram. The tablet is able to interact with 3D content through touch, spatial positioning, and tangible markers, however, 3D content is still presented on a 2D surface. Our hypothesis is that visualization environments that match human perceptual and interaction capabilities better to the task at hand improve understanding of 3D visualizations. To better understand the space of display and interaction modalities in visualization environments, we first propose a classification based on three dimensions: perception, interaction, and the spatial and cognitive proximity of the two. Each technique in our study is located at a different position along these three dimensions. We asked 15 participants to perform four tasks, each task having different levels of difficulty for both spatial perception and degrees of freedom for interaction. Our results show that each of the tested environments is more effective for certain tasks, but that generally the desktop environment is still fastest and most precise in almost all cases.},

HoloBee was designed to allow for interactive exploration of bee behaviour and specifically bee drift: the phenomenon of a bee leaving a hive and returning to another hive. For exploration in the bees' natural environment, bee drift is visualised as arcs connecting bee hives positioned in 3D geospatial maps. We describe in detail the design aspects of HoloBee, including command language, system feedback, and information display. We discuss the unique capabilities and limitations of the HoloLens as a guide to other researchers who intend to use it for visual analytics of spatio-temporal scientific data.},

The full range of SSCI journals was surveyed and a total of 68 research articles were selected for analysis. The findings reveal an increase in the number of AR studies during the last four years. The most reported advantage of AR is that it promotes enhanced learning achievement. Some noted challenges imposed by AR are usability issues and frequent technical problems. We found several other challenges and numerous advantages of AR usage, which are discussed in detail. In addition, current gaps in AR research and needs in the field are identified, and suggestions are offered for future research.},

For augmented reality applications to be effective, users must be able to accurately perceive the intended real world location of virtual objects. However, when creating augmented reality applications, developers are faced with a variety of design decisions that may affect user perceptions regarding the real world depth of virtual objects. In this paper, we conducted two experiments using a perceptual matching task to understand how shading, cast shadows, aerial perspective, texture, dimensionality (i.e., 2D vs. 3D shapes) and billboarding affected participant perceptions of virtual object depth relative to real world targets. The results of these studies quantify trade-offs across virtual object designs to inform the development of applications that take advantage of users' visual abilities to better blend the physical and virtual world.},

abstract = {This paper presents an advanced human-computer interaction system which supports the design of 3D model and makes 3D prototypes by merging technologies such as augmented reality (AR), hand gesture recognition, and 3D printing. This proposed development provides a system to enhance the user's experience in designing of 3D model (3D prototypes). Beginners or novice designers can design 3D model intuitively. The proposed system provides an ability of manipulating with 3D model in 3D space such as translating, rotating, and scaling. Leap Motion was used to detect and recognize the hand gesture using the skeleton-based algorithm. This device sends the data of hand positions and gesture commands to display the virtual hands on the Microsoft HoloLens. The graphic manager manages the registration between the coordinate frame of Leap Motion and Microsoft HoloLens' frame. The gesture-based modeling technique allows the user to design and manipulates 3D holographic objects. In addition, the HoloLens application is used to visualize holograms in the real environment's scale. The designed holographic objects can be assembled, disassembled, interacted with the real environment surface. The holographic objects can be exported into the CAD file format from the mesh rendering to the ASCII STL structure which can be printed by a 3D printer automatically. In the experiment, the holographic objects can be modeled relatively to the physical objects. The system has been tested by eight participants. The purpose of this experiment was to explore the intuitive interaction techniques which facilitated in the designing and validated the relation between physical objects and holographic object. The output of the experiment was the real 3D printed prototype obtained from the designed holographics. The results of the system performance covered the operations such as translation, rotation, and scaling of holographic objects with respective to the actual object, the averaged time of designing, the precision of hand gesture interaction, and the usability.},

These applications show that VLE can be means of enhancing, motivating and stimulating learners' understanding of certain events, especially those for which the traditional notion of instructional learning have proven inappropriate or difficult. Furthermore, the users can learn in a quick and happy mode by playing in the virtual environments.},

abstract = {We present experimental data on the limiting behavior of an interreality system comprising a virtual horizontally driven pendulum coupled to its real-world counterpart, where the interaction time scale is much shorter than the time scale of the dynamical system. We present experimental evidence that, if the physical parameters of the simplified virtual system match those of the real system within a certain tolerance, there is a transition from an uncorrelated dual reality state to a mixed reality state of the system in which the motion of the two pendula is highly correlated. The region in parameter space for stable solutions has an Arnold tongue structure for both the experimental data and a numerical simulation. As virtual systems better approximate real ones, even weak coupling in other interreality systems may produce sudden changes to mixed reality states.},

abstract = {Transferring research from the laboratory to mainstream applications requires the convergence of people, knowledge, and conventions from divergent disciplines. Solutions involve more than combining functional requirements and creative novelty. To transform technical capabilities of emerging mixed reality (MR) technology into the mainstream involves the integration and evolution of unproven systems. For example, real-world applications require complex scenarios (a content issue) involving an efficient iterative pipeline (a production issue) and driving the design of a story engine (a technical issue) that provides an adaptive experience with an after-action review process (a business issue). This article describes how a multi-disciplinary research team transformed core MR technology and methods into diverse urban terrain applications. These applications are used for military training and situational awareness, as well as for community learning to significantly increase the entertainment, educational, and satisfaction levels of existing experiences in public venues.},

abstract = {Since the Augmented Reality (AR) headset Microsoft HoloLens released in 2016, the academic and the industrial community witnessed an obvious transformation and changes in the perception of AR applications. Despite this breakthrough, most of the HoloLens users have explicitly reported the narrow field of view (FOV) that crops the virtual augmentation from the viewer's sight to a small window of 34 degrees (Bimber {\&} Bruns). This limitation can result in losing pre-made functions and visuals in the AR application. Therefore, this study introduced attempts to design a spatial UI representing a way around the narrow FOV that HoloLens suffers from. The UI was a crucial part of AR museum system which was evaluated by 9 experts in HCI, visual communication and museum engaging studies. Results showed a positive feedback on the usability of the system and user's experience. This method can help HoloLens developers to extend their applications functionalities with avoiding missing content.},

Offline local data access is supported and demonstrated by our Android application for reading and modifying data on each node via direct Bluetooth connection. Additionally, information among nodes, connected devices, and a remote server, is transmitted via a gateway over the Internet. We leverage the capabilities of the Microsoft HoloLens to provide augmented information and to create an up-to-date 3D scan of the environment on-site.

They were assigned to either an experimental or a control group. Qualitative and quantitative data collection tools were used. The experimental results obtained following the 5-week application revealed that the AR technology significantly enhanced the development of the university students' laboratory skills. AR technology both improved the students' laboratory skills and helped them to build positive attitudes towards physics laboratories.

To examine interactivity‟s influence on consumers‟ perceptions, we conducted a laboratory experiment using a simulated web-based, online payment system. When compared to a non-interactive preview of an online payment system, we found that consumers who used an interactive e-service simulation reported higher perceived involvement and authenticity as well as higher intangibility and risks of e-services. Further, we found that interactivity moderated relationships such that consumers were more likely to report higher intentions to use e- services.

The virtuality continuum, ranging from pure virtuality on one side to the real world on the other, has been successfully covered by the use of immersive technologies like head-mounted displays, which allow one to embed virtual objects into the real surroundings, leading to a Mixed Reality (MR) experience. In such an environment, digital and real objects do not only coexist, but moreover are also able to interact with each other in real time. These concepts can be used to merge human perception of reality with digitally visualized sensor data, thereby making the invisible visible. As a first example, in this paper we introduce alongside the basic idea of this column an MR experiment in thermodynamics for a laboratory course for freshman students in physics or other science and engineering subjects that uses physical data from mobile devices for analyzing and displaying physical phenomena to students.},
