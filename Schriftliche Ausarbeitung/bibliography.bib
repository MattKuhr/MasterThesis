abstract = {This chapter describes learning electromagnetism with visualizations and focuses on the value of concrete and visual representations in teaching abstract concepts. We start with a theoretical background consisting of three subsections: visualization in science, simulations and microcomputerbased laboratory, and studies that investigated the effectiveness of simulations and real-time graphing in physics. We then present the TEAL (Technology Enabled Active Learning) project for MIT's introductory electromagnetism course as a case in point. We demonstrate the various types of visualizations and how they are used in the TEAL classroom. A description of a large-scale study at MIT follows. In this study, we investigated the effects of introducing 2D and 3D visualizations into an active learning setting on learning outcomes in both the cognitive and affective domains. We conclude by describing an example of TEAL classroom discourse, which demonstrates the effects and benefits of the TEAL project in general, and the active learning and visualizations in particular.},

abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR), using a mixture of the virtual and physical world, has been recognized as a promising environment for improving the quality of collaboration in educational domains. To identify how an AR-supported simulation affects collaborative learning, this study compared collaborative learning effectiveness between the conditions of AR-supported and traditional face-to-face collaborative learning for Physics. The findings revealed that collaborative use of the AR-supported simulation resulted in higher levels of perceived skill development, self-reported learning and learning interest. The individual learning achievement was also strengthened with the use of AR-supported simulation in collaboration. This study provides empirical evidence for supporting the potential value of AR technology in collaborative learning practices and has implications for research on learning effectiveness evaluation in CSCL.},

abstract = {We present novel designs for virtual and augmented reality near-eye displays based on phase-only holographic projection. Our approach is built on the principles of Fresnel holography and double phase amplitude encoding with additional hardware, phase correction factors, and spatial light modulator encodings to achieve full color, high contrast and low noise holograms with high resolution and true per-pixel focal control. We provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of all holographic computation that integrates with the standard graphics pipeline and enables real-time (≥90 Hz) calculation directly or through eye tracked approximations. A unified focus, aberration correction, and vision correction model, along with a user calibration process, accounts for any optical defects between the light source and retina. We use this optical correction ability not only to fix minor aberrations but to enable truly compact, eyeglasses-like displays with wide fields of view (80°) that would be inaccessible through conventional means. All functionality is evaluated across a series of hardware prototypes; we discuss remaining challenges to incorporate all features into a single device.},

abstract = {Dealing with electromagnetic (EM) fields and microwaves for the first time, many students have problems to get an idea of the fields and their behavior in transmission-line structures and components. To reduce these barriers, animations generated by a time-domain field simulator can be used to demonstrate some basic time- and space-dependent properties of EM waves. In this paper, the application of a two-dimensional transmission-line matrix (2D-TLM) code for this purpose is described. Starting points are some introductory animations of basic wave propagation, e.g., in a parallel-plate waveguide, the incidence of a wave onto a lossy wall (skin effect), or the excitation of a wave in a dielectric slab (dielectric line). Later on, the fields in a number of transmission-line components like couplers or filters can be demonstrated in a very nice way. Further applications of this tool are found in demonstrating basic problems of electromagnetic compatibility like penetration through a metal shielding or through openings in a shell including resonance effects. Such animations are shown during the lectures using a video projector. In addition, the examples are offered to the students on a Web page both as animated gifs and as applications files for a 2D-TLM program to repeat and/or modify the experiment.},

With the introduction of the HoloLens (and increasingly other similar devices) a platform allowing widespread practical application of such solutions has finally become available. However, today, not many such real-world applications exist, and it is not yet fully understood which specific applications can benefit most from the technology in what form. As a promising novel application that optimally leverages the advantages of HMD based AR we propose a HoloLens based solution to support the debugging of electronic circuits. As a first step we have implemented a HoloLens interface to an oscilloscope. In this paper, we describe the general idea, the first implementation of the oscilloscope interface, and summarize initial qualitative feedback that we have received from users.},

The main aim is to summarize challenges in visualization methods for existing Big Data, as well as to offer novel solutions for issues related to the current state of Big Data Visualization. This paper provides a classificationof existing data types, analytical methods, visualization techniques and tools, with a particular emphasis placed on surveying the evolution of visualization methodology over the past years. Based on the results, we reveal disadvantages of existing visualization methods. Despite the technological development of the modern world, human involvement (interaction), judgment and logical thinking are necessary while working with Big Data. Therefore, the role of human perceptional limitations involving large amounts of information is evaluated. Based on the results, a non-traditional approach is proposed: we discuss how the capabilities of Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality could be applied to the field of Big Data Visualization. We discuss the promising utility of Mixed Reality technology integration with applications in Big Data Visualization. Placing the most essential data in the central area of the human visual field in Mixed Reality would allow one to obtain the presented information in a short period of time without significant data losses due to human perceptual issues. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of new technologies, such as Virtual Reality displays and Augmented Reality helmets on the Big Data visualization as well as to the classification of the main challenges of integrating the technology.},

abstract = {We report on a controlled user study comparing three visualization environments for common 3D exploration. Our environments differ in how they exploit natural human perception and interaction capabilities. We compare an augmented-reality head-mounted display (Microsoft HoloLens), a handheld tablet, and a desktop setup. The novel head-mounted HoloLens display projects stereoscopic images of virtual content into a user's real world and allows for interaction in-situ at the spatial position of the 3D hologram. The tablet is able to interact with 3D content through touch, spatial positioning, and tangible markers, however, 3D content is still presented on a 2D surface. Our hypothesis is that visualization environments that match human perceptual and interaction capabilities better to the task at hand improve understanding of 3D visualizations. To better understand the space of display and interaction modalities in visualization environments, we first propose a classification based on three dimensions: perception, interaction, and the spatial and cognitive proximity of the two. Each technique in our study is located at a different position along these three dimensions. We asked 15 participants to perform four tasks, each task having different levels of difficulty for both spatial perception and degrees of freedom for interaction. Our results show that each of the tested environments is more effective for certain tasks, but that generally the desktop environment is still fastest and most precise in almost all cases.},

For augmented reality applications to be effective, users must be able to accurately perceive the intended real world location of virtual objects. However, when creating augmented reality applications, developers are faced with a variety of design decisions that may affect user perceptions regarding the real world depth of virtual objects. In this paper, we conducted two experiments using a perceptual matching task to understand how shading, cast shadows, aerial perspective, texture, dimensionality (i.e., 2D vs. 3D shapes) and billboarding affected participant perceptions of virtual object depth relative to real world targets. The results of these studies quantify trade-offs across virtual object designs to inform the development of applications that take advantage of users' visual abilities to better blend the physical and virtual world.},

abstract = {This paper presents an advanced human-computer interaction system which supports the design of 3D model and makes 3D prototypes by merging technologies such as augmented reality (AR), hand gesture recognition, and 3D printing. This proposed development provides a system to enhance the user's experience in designing of 3D model (3D prototypes). Beginners or novice designers can design 3D model intuitively. The proposed system provides an ability of manipulating with 3D model in 3D space such as translating, rotating, and scaling. Leap Motion was used to detect and recognize the hand gesture using the skeleton-based algorithm. This device sends the data of hand positions and gesture commands to display the virtual hands on the Microsoft HoloLens. The graphic manager manages the registration between the coordinate frame of Leap Motion and Microsoft HoloLens' frame. The gesture-based modeling technique allows the user to design and manipulates 3D holographic objects. In addition, the HoloLens application is used to visualize holograms in the real environment's scale. The designed holographic objects can be assembled, disassembled, interacted with the real environment surface. The holographic objects can be exported into the CAD file format from the mesh rendering to the ASCII STL structure which can be printed by a 3D printer automatically. In the experiment, the holographic objects can be modeled relatively to the physical objects. The system has been tested by eight participants. The purpose of this experiment was to explore the intuitive interaction techniques which facilitated in the designing and validated the relation between physical objects and holographic object. The output of the experiment was the real 3D printed prototype obtained from the designed holographics. The results of the system performance covered the operations such as translation, rotation, and scaling of holographic objects with respective to the actual object, the averaged time of designing, the precision of hand gesture interaction, and the usability.},

We present experimental evidence that, if the physical parameters of the simplified virtual system match those of the real system within a certain tolerance, there is a transition from an uncorrelated dual reality state to a mixed reality state of the system in which the motion of the two pendula is highly correlated. The region in parameter space for stable solutions has an Arnold tongue structure for both the experimental data and a numerical simulation. As virtual systems better approximate real ones, even weak coupling in other interreality systems may produce sudden changes to mixed reality states.},

abstract = {Since the Augmented Reality (AR) headset Microsoft HoloLens released in 2016, the academic and the industrial community witnessed an obvious transformation and changes in the perception of AR applications. Despite this breakthrough, most of the HoloLens users have explicitly reported the narrow field of view (FOV) that crops the virtual augmentation from the viewer's sight to a small window of 34 degrees (Bimber {\&} Bruns). This limitation can result in losing pre-made functions and visuals in the AR application. Therefore, this study introduced attempts to design a spatial UI representing a way around the narrow FOV that HoloLens suffers from. The UI was a crucial part of AR museum system which was evaluated by 9 experts in HCI, visual communication and museum engaging studies. Results showed a positive feedback on the usability of the system and user's experience. This method can help HoloLens developers to extend their applications functionalities with avoiding missing content.},

To examine interactivity‟s influence on consumers‟ perceptions, we conducted a laboratory experiment using a simulated web-based, online payment system. When compared to a non-interactive preview of an online payment system, we found that consumers who used an interactive e-service simulation reported higher perceived involvement and authenticity as well as higher intangibility and risks of e-services. Further, we found that interactivity moderated relationships such that consumers were more likely to report higher intentions to use e- services.

abstract = {Fundamental concepts of thermodynamics rely on abstract physical quantities such as energy, heat and entropy, which play an important role in the process of interpreting thermal phenomena and statistical mechanics. However, these quantities are not covered by human (visual) perception and thus, an intuitive understanding often is lacking. Today immersive technologies like head-mounted displays of the newest generation, especially HoloLens, allow for high quality augmented reality learning experiences, which can overcome this perception gap and simultaneously avoid a split attention effect. In a mixed reality (MR) scenario as presented in this paper---which we call a holo.lab---human perception can be extended to the thermal regime by presenting false-color representations of the temperature of objects as a virtual augmentation directly on the real object itself in real-time. Direct feedback to experimental actions of the users in form of different representations allows for immediate comparison to theoretical principles and predictions and therefore is supposed to intensify the theory-experiment interactions and to increase the conceptual understanding. We tested this technology for an experiment on thermal conduction of metals in the framework of undergraduate laboratories. A pilot study with treatment and control groups (N = 59) showed a small positive effect of MR on students' performance measured with a standardized concept test for thermodynamics, indicating an improvement of the understanding of the underlying physical concepts.},

abstract = {In recent decades, many researches have been done on impact of technology on teaching and learning. However, many such studies were done back in 1990s and to-date technology has since improved by leaps and bounds. Hence, there is a need to look into how schools can tap into the current innovative technology and integrate it into the schools' teaching and learning (T{\&}L). This study uses Augmented Reality (AR) software in the T{\&}L of Science. AR has been widely published in Hollywood movie and often used in the making of special effects in movie. This study uses affordable and powerful AR software that is locally developed and applied on a Physics topic known as Kinematics graph analysis a topic that is difficult for our students to grasp when teaching it. There is also a call for a deeper research work that is not just based on impact of technology, but how to use pedagogy in information communication technology (ICT) based lesson. This study is both qualitative and quantitative that investigates how the impact of technology on the T{\&}L of a Physics topic designed with a sound pedagogy, in form of Inquiry based Learning (IBL). The focus of this study is on the effect of such integration on 40 secondary 3 students' (15 yrs old) learning attitude and academic achievement, in comparison with 40 controlled students.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a real-time visualization system utilizing Augmented Reality Technology for electromagnetics education. It gives an image of magnetic field generated by a bar magnet with a piece of iron in real-time, however the bar magnet and the piece of iron are represented by mock ones. In the newly proposed visualization system, these mocks are captured by a web camera, and mesh needed in the calculation of magnetic field is deformed. Subsequently, a finite element analysis is carried out in very short time and then the magnetic field is immediately visualized. Thereby, it is, in real-time, observable that magnetic flux lines generated by the bar magnet are attracted to a piece of iron. Moreover, when a user moves the mocks, the magnetic flux lines are immediately depicted according to the position of the mocks.},

abstract = {This study presents a systematic review of the literature on the use of augmented reality technology to support science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) learning. It synthesizes a set of 28 publications from 2010 to 2017. A qualitative content analysis is used to investigate the general characteristics of augmented reality applications in STEM education, the instructional strategies and techniques deployed in the studies reviewed, and the evaluation approaches followed in the interventions. This review found that most augmented reality applications for STEM learning offered exploration or simulation activities. The applications reviewed offered a number of similar design features based on digital knowledge discovery mechanisms to consume information through the interaction with digital elements. However, few studies provided students with assistance in carrying out learning activities. Most of the studies reviewed evaluated the effects of augmented reality technology in fostering students' conceptual understanding, followed by those that investigated affective learning outcomes. A number of suggestions for future research arose from this review. Researchers need to design features that allow students to acquire basic competences related with STEM disciplines, and future applications need to include metacognitive scaffolding and experimental support for inquiry-based learning activities. Finally, it would be useful to explore how augmented reality learning activities can be part of blended instructional strategies such as the flipped classroom.},

abstract = {In the field of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), technologies have made huge progress during the last years and also reached the field of education. The virtuality continuum, ranging from pure virtuality on one side to the real world on the other, has been successfully covered by the use of immersive technologies like head-mounted displays, which allow one to embed virtual objects into the real surroundings, leading to a Mixed Reality (MR) experience. In such an environment, digital and real objects do not only coexist, but moreover are also able to interact with each other in real time. These concepts can be used to merge human perception of reality with digitally visualized sensor data, thereby making the invisible visible. As a first example, in this paper we introduce alongside the basic idea of this column an MR experiment in thermodynamics for a laboratory course for freshman students in physics or other science and engineering subjects that uses physical data from mobile devices for analyzing and displaying physical phenomena to students.},

abstract = {Transferring research from the laboratory to mainstream applications requires the convergence of people, knowledge, and conventions from divergent disciplines. Solutions involve more than combining functional requirements and creative novelty. To transform technical capabilities of emerging mixed reality (MR) technology into the mainstream involves the integration and evolution of unproven systems. For example, real-world applications require complex scenarios (a content issue) involving an efficient iterative pipeline (a production issue) and driving the design of a story engine (a technical issue) that provides an adaptive experience with an after-action review process (a business issue). This article describes how a multi-disciplinary research team transformed core MR technology and methods into diverse urban terrain applications. These applications are used for military training and situational awareness, as well as for community learning to significantly increase the entertainment, educational, and satisfaction levels of existing experiences in public venues.},

abstract = {Educational researchers have recognized Augmented Reality (AR) as a technology with great potential to impact affective and cognitive learning outcomes. However, very little work has been carried out to substantiate these claims. The purpose of this study was to assess to which extent an AR learning application affects learners' level of enjoyment and learning effectiveness. The study followed an experimental/control group design using the type of the application (AR-based, web-based) as independent variable. 64 high school students were randomly assigned to the experimental or control group to learn the basic principles of electromagnetism. The participants' knowledge acquisition was evaluated by comparing pre- and post-tests. The participants' level overall-state perception on flow was measured with the Flow State Scale and their flow states were monitored throughout the learning activity. Finally, participants' perceptions of benefits and difficulties of using the augmented reality application in this study were qualitatively identified. The results showed that the augmented reality approach was more effective in promoting students' knowledge of electromagnetic concepts and phenomena. The analysis also indicated that the augmented reality application led participants to reach higher flow experience levels than those achieved by users of the web-based application. However, not all the factors seem to have influence on learners' flow state, this study found that they were limited to: concentration, distorted sense of time, sense of control, clearer direct feedback, and autotelic experience. A deeper analysis of the flow process showed that neither of the groups reported being in flow in those tasks that were very easy or too difficult. However, for those tasks that were not perceived as difficult and included visualization clues, the experimental group showed higher levels of flow that the control group. The study suggests that augmented reality can be exploited as an effective learning environment for learning the basic principles of electromagnetism at high school provided that learning designers strike a careful balance between AR support and task difficulty.},
